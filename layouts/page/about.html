    <h2>Andrew Stepanov</h2>
    <p>
        I am an engineering manager with first-hand experience in the field of machine learning
        and data analysis, including all stages of the ML pipeline from setting the objective to production.
        I know how to build and manage teams making services that sustain tens of thousands of
        requests per second under load running ML-heavy algorithms.
        Being a person of technical and ACM background, I have a deep understanding of how
        various aspects of modern ML in production stack up, including cold starting,
        perf optimization (CPU/GPU), cloud-native architecture and distributed systems,
        quality monitoring and continuously improving the model, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        Areas of interest and expertise: machine learning, distributed systems,
        cloud-native architecture, speech recognition and synthesis,
        C++ and Golang development, IT process improvement, big data processing.

                <p>
                    I manage a team of ~70 people with a primary goal of developing and maintaining a large suite of internal instruments,
                    infrastructure, and services aimed at reducing time to market and increasing ease of use for machine learning-based workflows
                    and products at the company. This includes computer vision and document recognition services, speech services, training and
                    serving infrastructure, confidential computing, etc. As a result, most ML engineers in the company do it via tools developed
                    in my department and a significant portion of the company's business teams use our ML SaaS solutions in their critical business paths.

                <p>
                    My team and I set out to test if a new SaaS business can be launched based on the voice tech we developed in the years prior.
                    My direct reports and I were responsible for go-to-market strategy, product offering, engineering management, and sales.
                    We managed to get 10s of paying enterprise customers and met our projections in the first and second years we operated.
                    Afterward, we deemed our idea successful and the business part transitioned to the separate IT monetization department.

                <p>
                    I managed a team of a dozen engineers and also took an active part in developing automatic speech recognition and speech synthesis systems
                    from scratch for one of the largest fintechs in Europe. My team was responsible for all parts of the machine learning cycle - 
                    from data collection and labeling to production deployment and quality monitoring. The system that we've built now processes tens of
                    billions of seconds of real-time speech, each month.

                    I consulted one of the biggest German fintechs in applying Machine Learning for customer care and support.
                    As a result of this work, the company managed to build an in-house team with the required expertise and focus on that particular area.
