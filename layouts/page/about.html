    <h2>Andrew Stepanov</h2>
    <p>
        I am an engineering manager with first-hand experience in machine learning
        and infra, including all stages of the ML pipeline, from aligning with business goals
        to designing the overall architecture to deploying a model in production.
        I know how to build and manage teams making business-critical services that sustain tens of thousands of RPS
        running ML-heavy algorithms.
    </p>
    <p>
        Being a person of technical and ACM background, I have a deep understanding of how
        various aspects of modern ML and software development stack up in production, including
        MLOps and CI/CD, quality monitoring and continuously improving the model,
        perf optimization (CPU/GPU), cloud-native and distributed systems, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am also passionate about growing people and pursuing knowledge. I try to make sure that all ICs and managers in my team
        learn something new and achieve project goals while showing strong sustained performance. I coached employees of
        different levels throughout their careers and have successfully grown both managers and senior engineers.

                <h4>Head of Department, ML Infrastructure and Services</h4>
                <div class="time-period"><time>Jan 2021</time> - <time>Present</time></div>
                <p>
                    I manage several teams of around 70 people in total, with a primary goal of developing and maintaining a large suite of internal
                    instruments, infrastructure, and services, aimed at reducing time to market and increasing ease of use for machine learning-based
                    workflows and products at the company. These include computer vision services, speech services, training and serving infrastructure,
                    labeling and data services, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also guided the company's transition from a bunch of different self-hosted ML solutions to a unified Machine Learning Platform
                    solving the needs in a structured way that promotes collaboration and knowledge sharing. As a result, ML engineers and business
                    teams in the company use the tools developed in my department on their critical paths.

                <h4>Head of Tinkoff VoiceKit</h4>
                <div class="time-period"><time>Jul 2019</time> - <time>Dec 2020</time></div>
                <p>
                    My team and I set out to test if we could turn the voice tech we developed years prior into a successful SaaS business.
                    My direct reports and I were responsible for go-to-market strategy, product offering, and sales while also maintaining and further developing
                    the service itself.
                    We managed to get 10s of paying enterprise customers and met our projections in the first and second years we operated.
                    Afterward, we deemed our idea successful, and the business part transitioned to a separate IT monetization department.

                <div class="time-period"><time>Jul 2016</time> - <time>Jun 2019</time></div>
                <p>
                    I managed a team of ML engineers that developed automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) services
                    from scratch for one of the largest fintechs in Europe. My team and I were responsible for all parts of the machine learning cycle - 
                    from data collection and labeling to production deployment and quality monitoring. I also contributed a lot myself and have in-depth knowledge of
                    modern ASR and TTS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The system now processes tens of billions of seconds of real-time speech each month and scores top places against the competition
                    in our language group, according to independent studies.

                <p>
                    I consulted one of the biggest German fintechs in applying Machine Learning for customer care and support.
                    As a result of this work, the company managed to build an in-house team with the required expertise and focus on that particular area.
